# Guides by [Easy Node ⚡ Professional Validators](https://easynode.one)
Welcome to Easy Node's Guides for [Harmony $ONE Protocol](https://harmony.one) & [Findora $FRA Validators](https://findora.org).

![Easy Node Logo](/easynode_weblogo.png)

## About Easy Node
We write guides and tools to help investors become validators on Harmony $ONE and Findora $FRA. Not everyone is a coder, we hope to give you the skills to manage your system daily while you install the software to get started.

Easy Node started as the validator `Slugom Crypto` back in March 2021. We've since released many tools for Validators and Delegators of Harmony ONE to utilize. We started validating on Findora in May 2022 and quickly updated our guides to include notes for people looking to run a Findora Validator.

You can find our current website at [EasyNode.ONE](https://easynode.one)!

You can find a deep dive on us in our [About Easy Node](/about) section.

This Documentation Guide repository has <Stars /> 🌟 on [GitHub](https://github.com/easy-node-one/guides). If you enjoy our guides can you head to [our page](https://github.com/easy-node-one/guides) and give us a 🌟 today? Thank you!

## About this guide
### Harmony ONE Guides
#### Staking Guide
Staking guide coming soon! In a future update we'll create full guides for staking either Harmony or Findora.

#### Validator Guide
While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions. 

We created a guide in March 2021 for New Validators to make it through the official documentation easier. That has become our "New Validators" section while the "Experienced Validators" covers using our advanced toolbox software.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    We highly suggest new Harmony $ONE Validators manually install their first server software setup before using our `validatortoolbox` application!
</Callout>

We updated the guide in May 2022 to have separate sections for Harmony & Findora.

### Findora Guides
#### Staking Guide
See our [Findora Page](https://guides.easynode.pro/findora) for info on how to buy FRA.

See this [Findora Wiki Page](https://wiki.dev.findora.org/docs/guides/staking-user-guide/) for instructions on how to stake with the [Official Findora Wallet](https://wallet.findora.org).

#### Validator Guides
We finished setup of our Findora Validator in May 2022. We've included some notes to assist with their guide which may have a few hurdles along the way.
