## Easy Node
Easy Node started as the validator `Slugom Crypto` back in March 2021. We've since gone through changes after helping release an installer and administrative assistant tool for Validators to utilize. You can find our current website at [EasyNode.ONE](https://easynode.one)!

## About this site
While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions.

This site was created to help anyone become a Harmony Validator and also to help existing Harmony Validator's manage their nodes better and more securly. This guide contains the following main sections:
- [New Validators](/companion) will want to go through this guide to setup their first server. This will give you the base you need to succeed. Our guide matches up with the official guide to tell you page by page what info to look for.
- [Existing Validators](/toolbox) will want this guide for installing Harmony on a new server via the validatortoolbox application.
- [Post Install](/post) will cover post installation for both the manual method and the validator toolbox.

## What is a Harmony Validator?
There's two ways that people in the Harmony Ecosystem refer to a "Harmony Validator"
- **Validator Wallet** - A wallet is simply upgraded to become a validator wallet. On the [staking portal](https://staking.harmony.one) you see the validator wallet addresses that were registered at creation time.
- **Validator Server** - The platform you use to create a wallet, create a validator, then later manage your "Harmony Validator"

## New Validators
This section is our original guide has morphed into our [New Validators](/companion) Guide. Learning everything by hand is necessary as there is no support or warranty when you run into issues on the blockchain!

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
In the `New Validator` guide we focus on building and running the nodes manually. You'll want all of this knowledge to help you come election time as only you support yourself as a validator.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    We highly suggest new validators manually install their first server software setup before using our `validatortoolbox` application!
</Callout>

## Existing Validators
This section is our [Validator Toolbox](/toolbox) Guide and has you covered to help you out with our Installer & Manage Menu application. 

If you're a returning visitor you probably want the [Quick Install](/toolbox/quick-install) instructions.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    New Validators can take a look at our installer, but please, learn how to do it by hand first!
