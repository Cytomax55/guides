#### Our notes on running a 2nd server for redundancy
---
# "Backup" Node
> As we [noted earlier](../../validator-guide-notes/software-setup/cloud-setup.md#server-requirements):
<div className="p-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-900 rounded mt-6">
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    <p>We recommend keeping your nodes as close to the west coast of USA as possible.</p>
    <p>Currently we use SFO on Digital Ocean and Silicon Valley on Vultr</p>
</Callout>
</div>
### Run another server using the same .key & .pass files as the first
> To run a backup node complete the same setup with the following changes:
> - 1. Import your wallet instead of creating one.
> - 2. Copy your key and pass files over from your other server
> One redundant/duplicate "backup" node is enough to cover you for many, many keys.
