#### Our notes on running a 2nd server for redundancy

# "Backup" Node

As we[ noted earlier](../../validator-guide-notes/software-setup/cloud-setup.md#server-requirements):

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend keeping your nodes as close to the west coast of USA as possible.  
  
Currently we use SFO on Digital Ocean and Silicon Valley on Vultr
{% endhint %}

### Run another server using the same .key & .pass files as the first

To run a backup node complete the same setup with the following changes:

1. Import your wallet instead of creating one.
2. Copy your key and pass files over from your other server

One redundant/duplicate "backup" node is enough to cover you for many, many keys.
