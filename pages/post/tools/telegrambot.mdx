Our notes on the telegram notification bot

## Telegram vStats Bot
Made by [Fortune.ONE Validator](https://twitter.com/Fortune__ONE), you will want to [setup this bot](https://t.me/vstatsbot) on telegram to notify you about issues. It's the best way to get notified of any problems.

This can also give you a summary of delegations (including delegations via metamask) and your wallet balances. You can watch multiple wallets and validators with this tool.

Message the bot and type `/start` to get started.
