# Current Stats Script
Get your stats here! Here's a simple script to poll your node and the blockchain.
## How do I see what block we're on?
We've released a [new python script](https://github.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/tree/main/stats) for finding stats on any server. You'll need to have python3 and pip3 installed for this to run.

To install the stats script run the following:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/harmony-validator-scripts/main/stats/stats.py && pip3 install colorama
```

After downloading the stats.py file you'll need to customize 2 lines inside of it.
```bash
ourShard='0'
harmonyFolder='~/harmony'
```

Save it and exit. Now that it's set up you can run it anytime with:

```bash
python3 ~/stats.py
```

Here's an example of Shard 3 in sync via the output of `python3 ~/stats.py`

![Example output of our stats.py script](/shard3_py.png)

Here's the breakdown of the output:

- First line is a simple print of the date & time
- Second Section - Compares shard 0 on your server to shard 0 on the blockchain.
- Third Section - Compares local shard (3 in this photo) on your server to shard on the blockchain
- Uptime - Your node information: how long it's been booted up, # of users, cpu load average - lower means less resources in use
- Harmony DB Size - A print out of the size of your databases noted with name to the right of each.
- Harmony Version - A print out of the current version of your harmony application
