# Findora Beginner Guide by EasyNode.Pro Validator

## About Easy Node
We write guides and tools to help investors become validators on Harmony $ONE and Findora $FRA. Not everyone is a coder, we hope to give you the skills to manage your system daily while you install the software to get started.

Easy Node started as the validator `Slugom Crypto` back in March 2021. We've since released many tools for Validators and Delegators of Harmony ONE to utilize. We started validating on Findora in May 2022 and quickly updated our guides to include notes for people looking to run a Findora Validator.

You can find our current website at [EasyNode.ONE](https://easynode.one)!

You can find a deep dive on us in our [About Easy Node](/about) section.
