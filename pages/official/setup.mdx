# Software Setup

> _**Update 9/20/2021 - Validator Toolbox by Easy Node Released!**_

**Our Validator Toolbox Installer is now ready to help you setup a node faster!** 

**If you are brand new to Harmony Validators the** [**New Users section**](https://validator-toolbox-guide.easynode.one/full-manual/pre-installation-information/new-validator-steps) **before you get started with the installation application!** 

**If you're just setting up another node for your pool, make sure you run through the** [**server prep requirements**](https://validator-toolbox-guide.easynode.one/full-manual/server-prep) **before using the Validator Toolbox Installer on your new server.  
  
We're leaving this guide as is as the information is still super useful but the toolbox can help reduce your setup & management learning curve!**

## **Original Software Setup Guide:**

This section has matching pages for each section of the [official guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) and you'll want to read our notes pertaining to those pages before proceeding with any commands in the official guide.

## The Easy Node Way

We suggest setting up your node "The Easy Node Way!!!"

* Setup a user account to run harmony
  * Don't use root or harmony as account names!!!
  * We suggest your username as something like serviceharmony which will be included in "The Slugom Way!!!"
* Use a folder in your user home directory to store harmony
  * We suggest /home/serviceharmony/harmony
