## cloud-init
Do you use a provider that has cloud-init features? Here's a custom cloud init to install everything you need to get Harmony OR Findora running faster out of the box!  

Includes all prerequisits and installs docker for you.  

To use the code below simply replace the ssh-rsa key with your id_rsa.pub key and set the username you'd like (currently `serficefindora` in 4 spots this example). The cloud-init does take a few minutes to run and if you're installing findora you'll need to reconnect and verify your user is in the docker group.

```text
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: servicefindora
    groups: sudo
    shell: /bin/bash
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - ssh-rsa AAAAB3N_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE_Fti7WjTlcTKjUkFMDDcfi5Q==
package_upgrade: true
runcmd:
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get upgrade -y
  - curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  - add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
  - apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io bind9-dnsutils git python3-pip python3-dotenv unzip -y
  - systemctl start docker
  - systemctl enable docker
  - usermod -aG docker servicefindora
  - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/findora-validator-scripts/main/node_init.sh -O /home/servicefindora/node_init.sh
  - git clone https://github.com/easy-node-one/validatortoolbox.git /home/servicefindora/validatortoolbox
  - pip3 install 
  ```

## Findora
To install a brand new Findora validator on a new wallet at this point simply run this once cloud-init downloads the file and you have docker group access:

```text
bash -x node_init.sh
```

## Harmony
The toolbox is already pulled into your home directory from github, to launch the toolbox run the following code to get started:

```text
cd validatortoolbox && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 ~/validatortoolbox/toolbox/install.py
```
