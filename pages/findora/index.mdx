# Guides by [Easy Node ⚡ Harmony ONE Community](https://easynode.one)
Welcome to Easy Node's Guides for [Harmony $ONE Protocol](https://harmony.one) & [Findora $FRA Validators](https://findora.org).

![Easy Node Logo](/easynode_weblogo.png)

## About Easy Node
Easy Node started as the validator `Slugom Crypto` back in March 2021. We've since released many tools for Validators and Delegators of Harmony ONE to utilize. We started validating on Findora in May 2022 and quickly updated our guides to include notes for people looking to run a Findora Validator.

You can find our current website at [EasyNode.ONE](https://easynode.one)!

You can find a deep dive on us in our [About Easy Node](/about) section.

This Documentation Guide repository has <Stars /> 🌟 on [GitHub](https://github.com/easy-node-one/guides). If you enjoy our guides can you head to [our page](https://github.com/easy-node-one/guides) and give us a 🌟 today? Thank you!

## About this guide
While [the Official Harmony $ONE Validator guide](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators) is quite amazing and helpful, there are some gaps left that may leave some new administrators with questions. 

We created a guide in March 2021 for New Validators to make it through the official documentation easier. That has become our "New Validators" section while the "Experienced Validators" covers using our advanced toolbox software.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    We highly suggest new Harmony $ONE Validators manually install their first server software setup before using our `validatortoolbox` application!
</Callout>

We updated the guide in May 2022 to have separate sections for Harmony & Findora.
