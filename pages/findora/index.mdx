## The Easy Node Way
When using our guides or tips you can always assume the following things that aren't really specified in the Harmony Documents. We call this "The Easy Node Way" which helps with organization and security:

-  Setup a user account to run docker & findora
  -  Don't use `root` or `findora` as account names!!!
  -  We suggest your username as something like `servicefindora`
