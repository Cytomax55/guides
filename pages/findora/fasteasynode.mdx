# Easy Node's Findora "Automated" Validator Setup Guide
This guide is for setting up a brand new wallet & validator for the first time. **Do not run this on your existing validator or your keys will be overwritten**  

We've created a pre-customized version of the node_installer script from Findora which we host publicly on our [github page here](https://github.com/easy-node-one/findora-validator-scripts). Some of those changes include:
- Adding in `fn` download and installation
- Making user agnostic, capture the user name that launces the script and recycle later when using sudo commands to avoid setting permissions to root by default
- Added a restart policy to the docker contianer to resume Findora validation if the server restarts unexpectedly

If you're moving to a new server you can use this installation but see our notes on moving over tmp.gen.keypair and priv_validator_key.json [right here](https://guides.easynode.one/findora/moving) once your brand new separate validator is synced up.

## Docker
Install docker on your Ubuntu 20.04LTS system with the following command. If you user isn't `servicefindora` update that to be your username in the following code before running it on your server:
```text
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - && sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" && sudo apt install docker-ce -y && sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

## Reconnect your session
Disconnect from your server and reconnect. Verify your user account is in the docker group by running the following code:
```text
groups
```

Once you've verified your user is in the docker group you can continue to the run installer step.

## Run Installer
Once you've logged back in and your user is in the docker group, run the folloing code to install a fully brand new Findora Validator:
```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-node-one/findora-validator-scripts/main/node_init.sh -O node_init.sh && bash -x node_init.sh
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
At this point you'll have a system that begins syncing automatically on the blockchain after the database download and unpacking completes. Wait for your `sync_status` to equal false before creating your validator or migrating to a new system.  
</Callout>

## After Installation
Some post installation tips once you stake and activate your validator.

### Fund Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#fund-your-validator) for the latest information on funding your validator. Due to missed block fees/slashing we recommend a bit more than the minimum amount for your validator.

### Create Validator, Stake FRA, Set Commission Rate, Start Validating and add to Dashboard
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#stake-initial-fra-and-set-commission-rate) for information on customizing and sending the command to create your validator.

After you sucessfully register your wallet and stake your initial Findora your validator will show up on the [staking dashboard](https://findorascan.io/nodes) along with the [SmartStake site](https://findora.smartstake.io/).

### Backup Recovery Data Files
Backup the following files, run `cat <filename>` to see the contents or use an sFTP program to transfer them to a secure location. These contain private information, do not share!!!

```bash
# Wallet recovery files
tmp.gen.keypair or /data/findora/mainnet/mainnet_node.key
node.mnemonic
# Validator information file, this one can be recreated but handy to save
staker_memo
```

Backup all files inside of the following folder as well:

```bash
# Validator recovery file
/data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/
```

## Monitor Validator
