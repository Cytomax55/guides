# Easy Node's Post Install Tips
Here's a few things to know and check up on after you get setup on Findora.

### Backup Key Files
Backup the following files, run `cat <filename>` to see the contents or use an sFTP program to transfer them to a secure location. These contain private information, do not share!!!

```bash
# Wallet recovery files
tmp.gen.keypair
node.mnemonic
# Validator information file, this one can be recreated but handy to save
staker_memo
```

Backup all files inside of the following folder as well:

```bash
# Validator recovery file
/data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/
```

### Common Commands
The most commonly used commands and how to find the rest that may be needed.

## Check Logs
Run the following to follow along live with your logs:

```bash
docker logs -f findorad
```

## Check Signing
Run the following on console on your server to show the latest stats.

```bash
fn show
```

## Check Status
If the following commands return status messages without any errors, then your node has been successfully configured and started:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:26657/status'
curl 'http://localhost:8669/version'
curl 'http://localhost:8668/version' # Only if you set the 'ENABLE_LEDGER_SERVICE'
curl 'http://localhost:8667/version' # Only if you set the 'ENABLE_QUERY_SERVICE'
```

## Validator Updates
See [this page](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/update-version) for tips & links to scripts to update the validator container.
### Update Image Version
The version_update_mainnet.sh script will stop your container, pull in any updates, and restart the container if your files are in the proper spot and your permissions are set properly.

## Updating Validator Information & Rate
Here's a few commands you'll use for submitting validator info & rate updates.
### Updating Validator Information
Simply edit your staker_memo file and then re-submit the updated information with following command:
`fn staker-update -M "$(cat staker_memo)"`

### Updating Rate (Fee)
If you would like to change your commission simply add the `-R` flag and your new rate, this is an example to set it to 5% commission:
`fn staker-update -R 0.05`

### Update Info & Rate
If you would like to update both at the same time you can chain the commands together, ie:
`fn staker-update -M "$(cat staker_memo) -R 0.05"`
