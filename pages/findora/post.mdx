## Check Status
If the following commands return status messages without any errors, then your node has been successfully configured and started:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:26657/status'
curl 'http://localhost:8669/version'
curl 'http://localhost:8668/version' # Only if you set the 'ENABLE_LEDGER_SERVICE'
curl 'http://localhost:8667/version' # Only if you set the 'ENABLE_QUERY_SERVICE'
```

### Validator Updates
See [this page](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/update-version) for tips on updating the validator containers.

There's 2 scripts on the page:

## Update Image Version
Edit the file you download for mainnet or testnet with the following changes so it works with our regular user account:

```bash
# Remove line #9 from the update image script
sudo mkdir -p /data/findora
```

## Safety Clean
No changes need to be made to this file, good to go as is.
