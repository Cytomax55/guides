### Our Notes on Moving Servers
For people looking to move providers and re-create a validator, you'll need to import a few files and **be sure to shut off the old server** long before recreating a server to avoid **double signing slashing (5% from your pool)**. The slashing fee for Missing Blocks is far less and easier to explain than getting slashed for 5%.

## Backup Files
You should already have a backup copy of the following files & folders:

```text
~/tmp.gen.keypair
/data/findora/mainnet/node.mnemonic
/data/findora/mainnet/mainnet_node.key
/data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/
```

When you get to running the automated script in the guide, you can make sure you've updated both of these files before you run the bash script to install.

## How to Migrate Servers
The best method to avoid double signing is to [use our installation guide](https://guides.easynode.one/findora/easynode) to setup a totally separate, brand new validator, new wallet and new private key doing a normal installation of Findora. Load your server up to the point of waiting for catching up to be `true` before proceeding to upgrading.  

### On your new server
Once you are synced up stop your container to being replacing your key files.  

```bash
docker container stop findorad
```

Verify your container is shut off by running `docker ps` and making sure that it no longer shows your findorad container as online.  

Once stopped, Update all of the following files with the same files on your old system:
- /data/findora/mainnet/node.mnemonic
- /data/findora/mainnet/mainnet_node.key

Update all the files in the following folder with the contents of the same folder on your old system:
- /data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config

Verify wallet information is shown in `fn show` with your proper wallet address showing. Verify it matches key on your old validator!  

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO START THE NEW SERVER YET OR YOU MAY DOUBLE SIGN**  

### On your old server
Now is the time to stop your old server to avoid having double singing.

Stop Docker To Stop Signing
```bash
docker stop findorad && docker rm findorad && rm -rf /data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/addrbook.json
```

I also shutdown the old server at this point to make sure there's 0 chance of double signing. You should be ok without shutting down but if you'd like to be safe run:
```bash
sudo init 0
```

**AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO FURTHER RISK OF DOUBLE SINGING BUT YOU ARE MISSING BLOCKS NOW**  

From here on down the guide the following tasks are time dependent as you'll begin to miss signatures at this point.  

### Back on your new server

- Restart your Findorad Docker Container using the update_image_version script:
```bash
wget https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/update_version_mainnet-4f20384f16d1f0e2d90e1f7ebc7ea935.sh && bash -x update_version_mainnet-4f20384f16d1f0e2d90e1f7ebc7ea935.sh
```  

Verify your server catches up and is now signing blocks.
