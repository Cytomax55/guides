### Our Notes on Moving Servers
For people looking to move providers and re-create a validator, you'll need to import a few files and be sure to shut off the old server long before recreating a server to avoid double signing slashing (5% from your pool). Missing blocks slashing is far less and easier to explain than getting slashed for 5%.

We'll make notes along the way on the files needed inside of our [installation guide](https://guides.easynode.one/findora/easynode) that you should provide. 

You'll want to remake the following files when the directories are created:

```text
~/tmp.gen.keypair
/data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

When you run the auto setup script it should detect that these files are in place.

If your validator address is different than what your old server has (or is different than the address ini priv_validator_key.json) then verify your priv_validator_key.json file is corrct or update it, reconnect it to `fn`, restart your docker container and it should start signing on your previous validator keys.
