# Findora Validator Guide
Here's a summary of our notes for setting up a Findora $FRA Validator and getting yourself online today!

Findora runs in a docker container and has an automated setup tool. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

[Findora Validator Official Guides](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup)
## Automated Setup
We will be using the automated setup method, but there's some items to get in order first that are left out of the official guide.

## Server Selection
Hardware Requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB Hard Disk

## Pre-Setup
### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the new user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. 

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

Confirm your user is in the proper groups with 

```bash
groups
```

```bash
Example Output
servicefindora sudo docker
```

## Installation
Install the fn software, create a wallet, prep server software, and stake your 10,000+ FRA to get started.
