# Findora Validator Guide
Here's a summary of our notes for setting up a Findora $FRA Validator and getting yourself online today!

Findora runs in a docker container and has an automated setup tool. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

## Server Selection
Hardware Requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB Hard Disk

## Pre-Setup
### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the new user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. Here's our notes for installing docker:
