# Findora Manual Validator Setup Guide
Here's a summary of our notes for setting up a Findora $FRA Validator and getting yourself online today!

Findora runs in a docker container. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

[Findora Manual Validator Setup Guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup)

## Before Starting
We will be using the manual setup method, but there's some items to get in order first that are left out of the official guide. We're going to skip making notes on most of this guide as it's good to go from top to bottom other than a few small details.

## Pre-Setup
We do suggest a few things before you start the manual install guide though, here's what to get done.

### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the new user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. 

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

At this point close your terminal and reconnect to enable the new permissions.

Once reconnected, confirm your user is in the proper groups with:

```bash
groups
```


Verify the output is similar to:

```bash
Example Output
servicefindora sudo docker
```

## Start Manual Installation
Now you're ready to use the [official guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup) to start installation. The official guide is pretty great and will cover everything you need to do a manual installation. Install the fn software, create a wallet, prep server software, and stake your 10,000+ FRA to get started.

## Notes On Each Section In Manual Install

### Download Validator Binaries and Pull Image
In this section you download the latest Findora docker imagge with the command.

### Configure Local Node
In this section, set the export as follows:

```bash
export ROOT_DIR=/data/findora/mainnet/
```

### Get Snapshot
"Download latest link and get url" as they state is where you'll run the main part of installation. Note at the top there's a command for testnet or mainnet, only run your preferred command.

### Create Wallet
Hidden in this section is wallet creation.

We suggest using a fresh wallet and creating your key file on your node for security. Always keep this information private as it unlocks access to your wallet. Here's the best way to set one up safely:

```bash
cd
fn genkey > tmp.gen.keypair
```

### Store Security key
Copy your security key to the location in this section. We also suggest keeping a copy in your home directory.

### Store Mnemonic Words
This section shows you how to create $\{ROOT_DIR\}/node.mnemonic with your validator mnemonic phrases for the software to utilize.

### Create Memonic File
When you create your mnemonic files, make a backup copy to restore on another server later in case of disaster.

### Configure your validator node to use your newly generated public and private keys
We still need to link your wallet to `fn` so follow these instructions.

### Start or Upgrade Local Node Tip!
In the [start or upgrade local node] section there is a \ missing from the command, here's the working command if you run into issues here:

```bash
# Stop your local container if necessary
docker rm -f findorad || exit 1
# Start your validator container
docker run -d \
    -v $\{ROOT_DIR\}/tendermint:/root/.tendermint \
    -v $\{ROOT_DIR\}/findorad:/tmp/findora \
    -p 8669:8669 \
    -p 8668:8668 \
    -p 8667:8667 \
    -p 26657:26657 \
    -e EVM_CHAIN_ID=2153 \
    --name findorad \
    findoranetwork/findorad:latest node \
    --ledger-dir /tmp/findora \
    --tendermint-host 0.0.0.0 \
    --tendermint-node-key-config-path="/root/.tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json" \
    --enable-query-service \
    --enable-eth-api-service
```

## Validator Commands
We cover commands for checking your information [here](/findora/post).

### Update Validator Information or Commission
Update your staker_memo file information and then you can perform the following command to send a transaction to update your dashboard information.

Run the following in the same directory as your staker_memo file:
```bash
fn staker-update -M "$(cat staker_memo)"
```

### Fund Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup#fund-your-validator) for the latest information on funding your validator. Due to missed block fees/slashing we recommend a bit more than the minimum amount for your validator.

### Stake FRA, Set Commission Rate, Start Validating and add to Dashboard
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup#stake-initial-fra-and-set-commission-rate) for information on customizing and sending the command to create your validator.

After you sucessfully register your wallet and stake your initial Findora your validator will show up on the [staking dashboard](https://findorascan.io/nodes) along with the [SmartStake site](https://findora.smartstake.io/).

## Post Installation
At this point both our guides come [back together](/findora/post) to talk about what commands you need to monitor your validator and other good to know information!
