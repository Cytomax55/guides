# Findora Manual Validator Setup Guide
Here's a summary of our notes for setting up a Findora $FRA Validator and getting yourself online today!

Findora runs in a docker container. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

[Findora Manual Validator Setup Guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup)

## Before Starting
We will be using the manual setup method, but there's some items to get in order first that are left out of the official guide.

## Server Selection
Grab a server, the Hardware Requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB Hard Disk

## Pre-Setup
### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the new user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. 

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

At this point close your terminal and reconnect to enable the new permissions.

Once reconnected, confirm your user is in the proper groups with:

```bash
groups
```


Verify the output is similar to:

```bash
Example Output
servicefindora sudo docker
```

## Start Manual Installation
Now you're ready to use the [official guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/manual-setup) to start installation. The official guide is pretty great and will cover everything you need to do a manual installation. Install the fn software, create a wallet, prep server software, and stake your 10,000+ FRA to get started.

## Notes

### Create Wallet
We suggest using a fresh wallet and creating your key file on your node for security. Always keep this information private as it unlocks access to your wallet.

### Create Memonic File
When you create your mnemonic files, make a backup copy to restore on another server later in case of disaster.

### Start or Upgrade Local Node Tip!
In the [start or upgrade local node] section there is a \ missing from the command, here's the working command if you run into issues here:

```bash
# Stop your local container if necessary
docker rm -f findorad || exit 1
# Start your validator container
docker run -d \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint:/root/.tendermint \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/findorad:/tmp/findora \
    -p 8669:8669 \
    -p 8668:8668 \
    -p 8667:8667 \
    -p 26657:26657 \
    -e EVM_CHAIN_ID=2153 \
    --name findorad \
    findoranetwork/findorad:latest node \
    --ledger-dir /tmp/findora \
    --tendermint-host 0.0.0.0 \
    --tendermint-node-key-config-path="/root/.tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json" \
    --enable-query-service
    --enable-eth-api-service
```

### Post Script Configuration
We still need to link your wallet to `fn` which is [covered here](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#setup-fn-cli-tool).

## Post Installation
Some post installation tips once you stake and activate your validator.

### Update Validator Information or Commission
Update your staker_memo file information and then you can perform the following command to send a transaction to update your dashboard information.

Run the following in the same directory as your staker_memo file:
```bash
fn staker-update -M "$(cat staker_memo)"
```

### Fund Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#fund-your-validator) for the latest information on funding your validator. Due to missed block fees/slashing we recommend a bit more than the minimum amount for your validator.

### Stake FRA, Set Commission Rate, Start Validating and add to Dashboard
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#stake-initial-fra-and-set-commission-rate) for information on customizing and sending the command to create your validator.

After you sucessfully register your wallet and stake your initial Findora your validator will show up on the [staking dashboard](https://findorascan.io/nodes) along with the [SmartStake site](https://findora.smartstake.io/).

### Node Operations
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#node-operations) for the latest commands for your Validator.

### Node information
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#view-node-information) for the latest way to get your Validator information.

### Claim Rewards
If your validator is one of the top 100 validators in total staked/delegated you will be eligible to recieve rewards. See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#claim-fra-rewards) for info on how to claim them on your server. If you import your wallet info into the official wallet you can claim via the UI. Rewards are paid out for each successful block your validator proposes on Findora.

### Unstake
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#unstake-fra) for info on how to unstake some of your validator's FRA.

### Close Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#close-validator-and-unstake-all-of-your-fra) for info on how to claim all your FRA and close down your validator
