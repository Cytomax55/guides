# Easy Node's Findora "Automated" Validator Setup Guide
We find that only using the automated setup has some challenges unless you're comfortable running your applications as root (We are not comfortable with that and will guide you through setting up a user to run findora as instead!).

Findora runs in a docker container and has an automated setup tool. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

We will often reference the [Findora Automated Validator Setup Guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup) please have this open as well.

## Server Selection
Grab a server, the Hardware Requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB Hard Disk

## Server Pre-Installation Setup
Once you have a server running Ubuntu and are logged in as a root account to start, here's the setup setps.

### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize the username to your liking:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the new user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. 

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

At this point close your terminal and reconnect to enable the new permissions.

Once reconnected, confirm your user is in the proper groups with:

```bash
groups
```

Verify the output is similar to:

```bash
Example Output
servicefindora sudo docker
```

### `fn` Installation
Run the following to download and setup the main app `fn`:

```bash
# download and move to your path
wget https://wiki.findora.org/bin/linux/fn
chmod +x fn
sudo mv fn /usr/local/bin/
```

### Create Wallet
We suggest using a fresh wallet and creating your key file on your node for security. Always keep this information private as it unlocks access to your wallet. To generate a new wallet run the following command:

```bash
# pre-set some exports and set permissions for your user account
export NAMESPACE=mainnet
# create folders and set permissions, customize username if different than `servicefindora`
sudo mkdir -p /data/findora
sudo chown servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora
mkdir -p /data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/
export ROOT_DIR=/data/findora/mainnet/
sudo chown -R servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora/
# send command to create wallet
fn genkey > tmp.gen.keypair
# backup file in your home directory
cp tmp.gen.keypair ~/
cp tmp.gen.keypair /data/findora/mainnet/mainnet_node.key
```

### Create Validator Key and Tendermint Files

```bash
# this container runs and creates some files but runs quickly
docker run --rm -v ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint:/root/.tendermint findoranetwork/findorad:latest init --mainnet || exit 1
# fix permissions after this
sudo chown -R servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora/
```

### Create memonic file
Setup private info for the app to access wallet:

```bash
# ex)
# echo "repair drink action brass term blur fat doll spoon thumb raise squirrel tornado engine tumble picnic approve elegant tube urge ghost secret seminar blame" > ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic
echo <24 mnemonic keywords> > ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic
```

### Finish setup of fn
Run the following commands to configure `fn` at this point:

```bash
fn setup -S https://prod-mainnet.prod.findora.org
fn setup -O ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic
fn setup -K ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

### Create initial docker container
To avoid a future bug, manually run this at this point to download the container image and initialize items:

```bash
docker run -d \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint:/root/.tendermint \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/findorad:/tmp/findora \
    -p 8669:8669 \
    -p 8668:8668 \
    -p 8667:8667 \
    -p 8545:8545 \
    -p 26657:26657 \
    -e EVM_CHAIN_ID=2152 \
    --name findorad \
    ${FINDORAD_IMG} node \
    --ledger-dir /tmp/findora \
    --tendermint-host 0.0.0.0 \
    --tendermint-node-key-config-path="/root/.tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json" \
    --enable-query-service \
    --enable-eth-api-service
```

### Download Script

See [this link](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#download-and-run-the-automated-setup-script) to get the most updated version of the installation script for Testnet or Mainnet.

Example command you can use to download the script to your server, **copy the current link from their guide as it may be newer!**:

```bash
wget https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/node_init_mainnet-423a36f2afake9de7ff63e61d3d4c1.sh
```

### Customize Script
We suggest making two modifications to the script before you run it to allow everything to flow as your regular user account. 

Edit the file you download (for either mainnet or testnet) with the following changes so it works with our regular user account:
```bash
# Remove line #37 from the automated install script
sudo mkdir -p /data/findora
# Update line #74 (75 before you delete the line above), remove sudo and update user account
chown -R servicefindora:servicefindora ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint/
```

### Run script
You should now be ready to run the automated installation script. This will pull in all files need and extract them. It may take 15+ minutes for this to complete but if all is successful you will be online and the database will be syncing:

```bash
bash -x node_init_mainnet-423a36f2afake9de7ff63e61d3d4c1.sh
```

## After Installation
Some post installation tips once you stake and activate your validator.

### Fund Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#fund-your-validator) for the latest information on funding your validator. Due to missed block fees/slashing we recommend a bit more than the minimum amount for your validator.

### Create Validator, Stake FRA, Set Commission Rate, Start Validating and add to Dashboard
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#stake-initial-fra-and-set-commission-rate) for information on customizing and sending the command to create your validator.

After you sucessfully register your wallet and stake your initial Findora your validator will show up on the [staking dashboard](https://findorascan.io/nodes) along with the [SmartStake site](https://findora.smartstake.io/).

## Monitor Validator
