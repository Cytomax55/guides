# Easy Node's Findora "Automated" Validator Setup Guide
This guide is for setting up a brand new wallet & validator for the first time. 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you're moving to a new server you can mostly use this guide but see our notes on moving over tmp.gen.keypair and priv_validator_key.json [right here](https://guides.easyonde.one/findora/moving).
</Callout>

## Intro
We find that only using the automated setup has some challenges unless you're comfortable running your applications as root (We are not comfortable with that and will guide you through setting up a user to run findora as instead!).

Findora runs in a docker container and has an automated setup tool. With a little massaging you can get this to run flawlessly with a regular user account and not using root.

We will often reference the [Findora Automated Validator Setup Guide](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup) please have this open as well.

### Server Selection
Grab a server, the Hardware Requirements:
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB NVMe Hard Disk

## Server Pre-Installation Setup
Once you have a server running Ubuntu and are logged in as a root account to start, here's the setup setps.

### Firewall
Open the following ports on your firewall for SSH access & Findora:

```text
22
8545
8667-8669
26657
```

### User Account
Setup a user account, give it access to the sudo (root) group. We will use the account `servicefindora` in this example but feel free to customize the username to your liking:

```bash
adduser servicefindora
```

Set a password, you can skip filling out the user info by pressing enter to leave it blank, confirm creation of new account. Then add permissions:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo servicefindora
```

Now you can disconnect and reconnect as the newly created user account. You can also prep the user account `~/.ssh` folder and SSH keys to use that login option at this time if you use keys for login access.

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker. 

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
At this point you'll need to **disconnect and reconnect** for the group permissions to be applied. Close out and reconnect! Once reconnected, confirm your user is in the proper groups with:
</Callout>

```bash
groups
```

Verify the output is similar to:

```bash
Example Output
servicefindora sudo docker
```

### `fn` Installation
Run the following to download and setup the main app `fn`:

```bash
# download and move to your path
wget https://wiki.findora.org/bin/linux/fn
chmod +x fn
sudo mv fn /usr/local/bin/
```

### Create Wallet, Directory Structure, and Move Keys
Run initial setup items:

```bash
# go to your home directory
cd ~/
# pre-set some exports and set permissions for your user account
export NAMESPACE=mainnet
# create folders and set permissions, customize username if different than `servicefindora`
sudo mkdir -p /data/findora
sudo chown servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora
mkdir -p /data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/
export ROOT_DIR=/data/findora/mainnet/
sudo chown -R servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora/
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
Create or import your wallet. **Note**: This next step creates a wallet if you need a new wallet. Otherwise you would instead import your wallet (create the file tmp.gen.keypair file) with your previous information!
</Callout>

If you're creating a new wallet run the following:

```bash
# send command to create wallet
fn genkey > tmp.gen.keypair
```

If you're importing a wallet you can use `cat ~/tmp.gen.keypair` to see if your key is loaded or use `nano ~/tmp.gen.keypair` or `vim ~/tmp.gen.keypair` to edit your file to restore it.

Move your wallet to the key location:

```bash
# copy key file to location that validator will use now that the location exists
cp tmp.gen.keypair /data/findora/mainnet/mainnet_node.key
```

### Create Memonic File
Setup private phrase info for the `fn` application to access your wallet. If you need your mnemonic phrase run `cat tmp.gen.keypair` to reveal your **private validation information and mnemonic words** to you. This is a good time to make a copy/back up your wallet file information (tmp.gen.keypair) for restoration of your validator:

```bash
# ex)
# echo "repair drink action brass term blur fat doll spoon thumb raise squirrel tornado engine tumble picnic approve elegant tube urge ghost secret seminar blame" > ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic
echo <24 mnemonic keywords> > ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic
```

### Create Docker Container
To avoid a future bug, manually run this at this point to download the container image and initialize items:

```bash
docker run -d \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint:/root/.tendermint \
    -v ${ROOT_DIR}/findorad:/tmp/findora \
    -p 8669:8669 \
    -p 8668:8668 \
    -p 8667:8667 \
    -p 8545:8545 \
    -p 26657:26657 \
    -e EVM_CHAIN_ID=2152 \
    --name findorad \
    ${FINDORAD_IMG} node \
    --ledger-dir /tmp/findora \
    --tendermint-host 0.0.0.0 \
    --tendermint-node-key-config-path="/root/.tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json" \
    --enable-query-service \
    --enable-eth-api-service
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
    If you're moving servers, this is the time to create your /data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/priv_validator_key.json file
</Callout>


### Download Auto Installation Script

See [this link](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#download-and-run-the-automated-setup-script) to get the most updated version of the **node_init_mainnet.sh** script to run.

Example command you can use to download the script to your server, **copy the current link from their guide as it may be newer!**:

```bash
wget https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/node_init_mainnet-423a36f2adaaeab9de7ff63e61d3d4c1.sh
```

### Edit Script
We suggest making two modifications to the script before you run it to allow everything to flow as your regular user account.

Edit the file you download with the following changes so it works with our regular user account using `nano` or `vim`:

```bash
# Remove line #37 from the automated install script
sudo mkdir -p /data/findora
# Update line #74 (75 before you delete the line above), remove sudo and update user account
sudo chown -R servicefindora:servicefindora /data/findora
```

### Run script
You should now be ready to run the automated installation script. This will pull in all files need and extract them. It may take 15+ minutes for this to complete but if all is successful you will be online and the database will be syncing:

```bash
bash -x node_init_mainnet-423a36f2adaaeab9de7ff63e61d3d4c1.sh
```

## After Installation
Some post installation tips once you stake and activate your validator.

### Fund Validator
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#fund-your-validator) for the latest information on funding your validator. Due to missed block fees/slashing we recommend a bit more than the minimum amount for your validator.

### Create Validator, Stake FRA, Set Commission Rate, Start Validating and add to Dashboard
See [this section](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup#stake-initial-fra-and-set-commission-rate) for information on customizing and sending the command to create your validator.

After you sucessfully register your wallet and stake your initial Findora your validator will show up on the [staking dashboard](https://findorascan.io/nodes) along with the [SmartStake site](https://findora.smartstake.io/).

### Backup Recovery Data Files
Backup the following files, run `cat <filename>` to see the contents or use an sFTP program to transfer them to a secure location. These contain private information, do not share!!!

```bash
# Wallet recovery files
tmp.gen.keypair
node.mnemonic
# Validator information file, this one can be recreated but handy to save
staker_memo
# Validator recovery file
/data/findora/mainnet/tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json
```
