# Changing Shards
Some quick notes on swapping shards. This is an advanced tactic which requires some previous knowledge to pull off.

## How to move shards at an epoch change
There's some things you'll need to get ready on the front end to swap shards:
- Spin up a server on your new shard, creating new .key/.pass files (or loading ones you previously had for the target shard), and get the database in sync
- Once synced up you are ready to add the new key from the new shard onto the blockchain via `edit-validator` commands
- Once new keys are added, remove the old keys from the old shard
- Leave both servers online until the epoch election happens
- After the election, when the old server is done signing for the previous epoch you can shut down/retire/archive the server as per usual
- New server will sign after the election using your newly added keys
