# Create A User Account
How to create a regular user account in linux to use for login.

## Make a regular user account
Since there are many versions of Linux we won't cover this in depth but here's what you'll need to do:
- never run as `root`
- Make a regular user account
- Setup SSH key pairs for login
- Here's [a guide](https://www.linuxbabe.com/linux-server/setup-passwordless-ssh-login) covering ssh key pair creation and usage in depth.
    - We highly suggest SSH key login and disabling password logins for security purposes.
- We suggest using [Termius](/companion/new/tools#termius) for file transfers the easy way on windows
- If you have problems google how to make a user account and how to give it root access for your provider or operating system as that has too many variables to cover.
- We suggest using the name `serviceharmony` or something similar for your account to keep it unique. The official guide suggests `harmony` but that can lead to confusion having your account named the same as the folder it's in and having an app of the same name.

## Creation Commands
After you log into your new server as root perform the following:
```bash
adduser
```

Answer the prompted questions (you can just leave them blank, this is just local info on your server).

Then add your new user to the sudoers group. Replace serviceharmony with your username if you're deviating. 

```bash
usermod -aG sudo serviceharmony
```

## New User ready
You can now login as the new user using the password created.

## SSH Key Login
You'll want to setup SSH Key Login. See [this guide](https://www.linuxbabe.com/linux-server/setup-passwordless-ssh-login) for info on creating, installing and managing SSH Keys.
