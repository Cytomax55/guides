## Validator Wallet

### Create A Wallet
We suggest creating a brand new wallet and only using your designated "Validator Wallet" for validating and collecting the rewards you get from it to keep your data separate.

#### Option A: Create a fresh wallet on your first server
You can create a wallet on your own node by running the following commands.

```bash
cd ~/harmony
./hmy keys add serviceharmony --passphrase
```

It will ask for your password twice, and then repeat back your mnemonic phrase. Keep it somewhere safe and secure and never share it with anyone! **You only get one shot at writing down your mnemonic phrase with this option, be very careful and record it properly**

#### Option B: Wallet Import
You also have the option of restoring an imported wallet. 

- At this time you cannot use a hardware wallet to manage your server.
- You must also import your validator wallet into metamask to vote on snapshot.org. The VDAO is looking into allowing a proxy wallet to vote in the future.

## Fund Wallet
Send at least 10001 Harmony $ONE to the new wallet you have created before you send your `create-validator` command on the blockchain during the Official Setup.
