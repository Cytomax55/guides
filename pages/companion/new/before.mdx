# What to expect before becoming a validator
Before you get started on making a validator we'll be covering these things that come up often. Here's a long list of things to read and think about before you proceed with jumping into becoming a validator.
### How much time does it take to manage a validator?
When you first start you spend more time watching your validator every 18 hours. As you gain delegations you can learn more and further automate things to free up more time. There are some skills that need to be learned so that may increase the learning curve for some administrators.
## Linux Administrator Skills
You'll have to commit to learning how to become a Linux Administrator, keep up with the server admin changes for Harmony and have time to assist your delegators if issues arise.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
In reality you should probably already have a few years of Linux systems administrations skills under your belt already if you decide to get into running a validator. It's still possible to learn everything you need to know in a rapid amount of time if you've got computer basics down. Here's some things to be familiar with.
</Callout>
Understand every command you run before you execute it and why you are performing it
- Be familiar with virtual machines and Ubuntu Server
- Know how to create, manipulate and update files and directories
- Know how to manage file permissions
- Know how to create users and manage permissions
- Know how to manage and modify bash scripts
- Know how to manage services
- Know how to read logs and troubleshoot issues that may arise.
At this point if you're no longer interested any further at running a validator [staking is a wonderful option](https://bit.ly/slugomvalidator) with a lot less work to get a bigger reward than validators make off of fees.
> If you're familiar with most of this you can skip to the parts you need more info on or go straight to our [Post Install - Pro Tips section](/companion/post).
If you do not know how to complete the tasks on the list above keep reading before you decide to jump into the life of 18 hour cycles as full time validator.

## Hardware & Providers
We'll cover this later, there's a lot of items to become familiar with before you start loading software. Here's some options you'll have to choose from later:
- Cloud Providers
- Home Hosted
    - Linux Servers
    - Raspberry Pi

## Operating System
We use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS only as recommended by Harmony. 

## Validator Wallet

### Create A Wallet
We suggest creating a brand new wallet and only using your designated "Validator Wallet" for validating and collecting the rewards you get from it to keep your data separate.

#### Option A: Create a fresh wallet on your first server
You can create a wallet on your own node by running the following commands.

```bash
cd ~/harmony
./hmy keys add serviceharmony --passphrase
```

It will ask for your password twice, and then repeat back your mnemonic phrase. Keep it somewhere safe and secure and never share it with anyone! **You only get one shot at writing down your mnemonic phrase with this option, be very careful and record it properly**

#### Option B: Wallet Import
You also have the option of restoring an imported wallet. See [this section](/companion/new/before#initial-wallet--funds) of our original guide on how to restore a wallet.

- At this time you cannot use a hardware wallet to manage your server.
- You must also import your validator wallet into metamask to vote on snapshot.org. The VDAO is looking into allowing a proxy wallet to vote in the future.

## Fund Wallet
Send at least 10001 Harmony $ONE to the new wallet you have created before you send your `create-validator` command on the blockchain during the Official Setup.

## BLS Keys
Currently the toolbox doesn't assist with BLS Keys. Support is planned in a future release. Here's the notes from our original guide on BLS Keys.

### Setting up BLS Keys
We suggest making 10 BLS keys on the shard you start with. Save them to your home PC. They can be reused anytime you deploy that shard again and only need to be created once. Once you have your .key & .pass files save them in a folder at home for reuse via WinSCP, scp, rsync, or however you send files to a server.

When you start you won't need more than 1 for quite some time \(at least 9.5 million $ONE today\) but if you have the others in place you won't need to restart your services and miss blocks to add more keys to your nodes.

### Creating new BLS keys
This covers creation of your BLS Key\(s\) that you decided on before starting the guide. We encourage you to run one on shards 1-3 instead of just 0.

Here you'll be creating the keys, creating a folder, and copying them into the proper folders. You may want to store a backup of these files as well.

To keep things simple, set up a password file before you begin. This will make it easy to copy the password to the required .pass files.

```s
cd ~/harmony
echo -E 'password' > blskey.pass
```

To create BLS Keys after you've completed the toolbox installation:

```s
./hmy keys generate-bls-keys --count 10 --shard 1 --passphrase-file blskey.pass
```
<p>This will create .key files in your ~/harmony directory. Copy those key files to your ~/harmony/.hmy/blskey folder.</p>
```s
cp *.key ~/harmony/.hmy/blskeys
```

The last step to use your blskey.pass file is to edit your harmony.conf file and setup the path.

```s
nano ~/harmony/harmony.conf
```

Change the line `PassFile = []` to read:

```s
PassFile = "./blskey.pass"
```

Save and exit nano (Ctrl+X y enter)

### Backup your .key and .pass files @ home or in the cloud
Using your [admin transfer tool](/companion/new/tools/) of choice, transfer your .key and .pass files to your home pc and store them securely. The key and pass files are all you need backed up to quickly restore a node. Once you create keys for a shard you can save them and re-use them when needed. They do not need to be created again once you have working copies backed up.
 
We suggest building a folder that contains a folder for each shard and storing your keys in there.

## User Account
Decide on the name for a local non-root [user account](/companion/new/users) to run the Harmony application as a service (don't pick root or harmony as the account name). The username should be all lower case. You'll get errors if you're  using capital letters in your username on Ubuntu.
<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
Do not run your software as root - it's just a terrible idea. Set up an account and use a folder for the software.
</Callout>

## Use a folder for Harmony
Our [suggested placement](/companion/new/folder) is at ~/harmony and our companion guide has commands to setup the folder before starting your work on the official guide.

## Create & Use SSH Keys for Login
Our suggested method of logging into our Linux servers. 
- Use [this guide](/toolbox/before/ssh-keys "Validator Toolbox Guide SSH Keys") for creating your ssh key pairs for use with Linux servers.
- Save that guide for later, you will want to use that to install Harmony in the future after you learn all of the commands by hand!

## Pick your shards
Decide on your shard setup. We encourage making your BLS keys on any of the numbered shards 1-3 instead of shard 0 at this current time.
- As of 5/1/2022 - The "snap" database is around 800GB. Plan on 1TB+ for storage as we add 10GB+ per day.
Loading a 2nd shard requires a 2nd database that currently takes around 18GB.

## Have enough storage for the future
Currently you will need around 1TB to get started but plan on 300GB+ a month or more as transactions increase.
- Harmony compacts the snap database on a regular basis. We will update when they reduce the size.

## Testnet
Should I run on Testnet first? If you're new to linux or validating, yes.
- Harmony has a testnet blockchain running for you to test out validator commands and functions on. We advise setting your first server up there and getting elected. Luckily, the official guide has tabs for all of the commands to use for Testnet vs Mainnet so it's just as easy to setup.
Keep an eye out for command windows that will have tabs to choose between `Mainnet` or `Testnet`.

## General Help
Beyond [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rcz5T6D9CV "Easy Node Discord Server Community") If you run into issues during your setup the best place to reach out for help is the [Harmony Mainnet Staking Telegram Channel](https://t.me/PangaeaVolunteers). A team of community volunteers is waiting to assist if you have any questions.
