# About
This section matches up page for page with the [Official Harmony Docs](https://docs.harmony.one). The official docs make some assumptions but then backtrack to talk about providers which is why we already covered that information.

In the next few sections you'll find Server Setup (Hardware), Node Setup (Harmony Software), Creating A Validator & Managing A Validator in the official documents to line up with.

Read our sections before going through the matching section of the same name in the official guide to save yourself some time!!!
